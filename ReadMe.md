# Burger

## Description

This app is meant to add new burgers to a ul of un-eaten burgers. You may then click a button to eat the burger, effectively moving it to the other side under Devoured. The data is persistent across sessions as they are stored in a SQL database. Further development would allow for deletion of the burgers that have already been devoured.
